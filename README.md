# real_estate

This is a a real estate website that I built as part of a course.
It's built using Bootstrap 4, Django, and PostgreSQL, and deployed on Digital Ocean using Nginx and Gunicorn. You can view the website at http://159.65.237.133/.

The website allows the user to:
1. Login
2. Search for properties by address, location, bedroom, size, etc.
3. Make inquries for certain properties (sent to the admin/realtor via an autoemail)
4. Add properites to a shopping cart

The admin is able to:
1. Add realtors to the website
2. Manage real estate listings
3. Manage user/realtor accounts
